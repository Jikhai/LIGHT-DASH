in order to reduce cpu usage, and response time, when accessing data recorded on large periods of time,
indexations through tables with a lower precision is needed. Levels of precision agreed on are the following :

10 minutes index


hour based index 


day based index 


week based index 


month based  ( constructs itself from day index)


year based index (from months)

as SQLIGHT doesn't support triggers, such things will be carried out through django (using signals ?)
